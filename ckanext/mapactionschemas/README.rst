Example:

"One of the following values:

`mapsheet` = Single page map - our most common product. These are the ones that could be automatically syndicated to RW)
`atlas` = [aka collection] (manual syndication to RW)
`powerpoint-map` = manual syndication to RW?
`webmap` = In a dataset the resources can point to webmaps hosted elsewhere. These could be automatically syndicated to RW.
`dataproduct`  (syndicate to HDX and not RW). Using ""dataproduct"" rather than ""datset"" could help avoid confusion with the CKAN meaning of ""dataset"".
`legacy` = Products with where produced prior to ~June2017, whose metadata might not comply with the updated and more tightly defined schema."
